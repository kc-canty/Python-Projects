# Python-Projects
A quick repo to show my growth as a Python developer.

# Python Learning Journey

This repository documents my ongoing growth as I learn Python from the ground up.  
My long-term goal is to become a cybersecurity professional with strong scripting and automation skills. Python is essential across security operations, threat hunting, automation, log analysis, and tooling — so this repo will serve as a living portfolio of my progress.

## What to Expect
- Beginner-friendly scripts as I build foundational skills  
- Gradually more complex projects to demonstrate growth  
- Cybersecurity-focused tools, utilities, and experiments  
- Clean, well-commented code to highlight understanding  

Each folder or script is labeled with a **skill level** and includes a short description of the concepts practiced.

## Roadmap
1. **Fundamentals** – Variables, loops, functions, file handling  
2. **Intermediate** – APIs, error handling, modular code, automation  
3. **Security-Oriented Projects** – log parsers, simple scanners, data extraction tools  
4. **Advanced Tools** – endpoint automation, alerting scripts, mini-SIEM utilities  

## Cybersecurity Focus
As I grow in my cybersecurity journey, this repo will evolve into a showcase of:
- Log analysis scripts  
- Basic automation for security tasks  
- Simple detection logic  
- Utilities for data parsing and reporting  

##  Current Status
Just getting started — expect the first beginner projects soon!
